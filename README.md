Weather-Information section

As a Full stack Web Developer, I created a dashboard that allow user to view the weather information upon a random selection of a city.




About


Using the selected city, the user is presented with current and forecast weather information.

It uses an openWeather API to retrieve information.

It displays general description, temperature, humidity and wind speed. 

It displays five days forecast weather information including the date, temperature, humidity, and wind speed.

It allows the user to store city in the local storage.
